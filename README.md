# LED-Control-System
A simple embedded system that allows you to control LED lighting using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. This project showcases basic embedded programming, hardware interfacing, and understanding of GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pins. You can also interact with the LEDs through push buttons or a mobile app.
